## Automated-Django-Project-Creation
So, you are a Django developer and you are so bored with all of the project creation stuffs. Don't worry, I can feel your pain. That's why I am here to make your Django Development career a little bit easier. This python script will take all of your hassle. Just run this script before starting a new Django project and this will take the rest of the responsibility.

## What will happen when you run this script ?
Well, first of all this is not a hacking script. So be cool now. 
This script will take your project name as input (steps shown below). And then it will first create a `virtual environment [venv]` and install Django there. After that it will activate the virtual environment and start a new Django project with your given name. And finally it will rename the Parent folder and append `-Project` string to it just to differentiate it from it's subfolder. It is not convention but it is MY practice and this script will work according to my practice.

## Manual
- Clone this repo to the folder in which you want to initiate your Django project. 
- Now open the CMD in the working directory and type:
```
create-project-django.py ProjectName. 
```
This will create a **virtual environment** and a Django project with your given **'ProjectName'**. 
- Finally The Parent folder is renamed with **'ProjectName-Project'** just to differentiate it from it's subfolder.

Thats it. Have fun.
