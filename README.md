## Automated-Django-Project-Creatation
A Python script to setup a Django project automatically with a virtual environment.

## Manual
- Clone this repo to the folder in which you want to initiate your Django project. 
- Now open the CMD in the working directory and type:
```
create-project-django.py ProjectName. 
```
This will create a **virtual environment** and a Django project with your given **'ProjectName'**. 
- Finally The Parent folder is renamed with **'ProjectName-Project'** just to differentiate it from it's subfolder.

Thats it. Have fun.
